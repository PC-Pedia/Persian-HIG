### 1.2 Scope

This document applies to all of the desktop applications running on popular GNU/Linux desktop environments including GNOME and KDE that are intended to be used by Persian speaking users in the Islamic Republic of Iran. It also applies to graphical user interface (GUI) applications that are multi-platform. Such software includes Web-based and Java applications. To enable development of the above applications, it also applies to the underlying platforms, toolkits and libraries.

In addition to the software specifically written for Persian/Iran locale, this document applies to internationalized software meant to be compatible with all GNU/Linux locales and also any software that is localized for Persian/Iran locale.

Many of the information, guidelines and rules provided in this document are not confined to a specific environment and operating system. So, it may be used for other platforms and environments where specific information and guidelines are not available.

This document does not cover text based user interfaces (command line and text terminal environments). This document does not cover special purpose user interfaces. Examples of special purpose interfaces include: Kiosk and game interfaces and none-desktop (e.g. handheld) user interfaces.

Also, this document does not cover vertical and special purpose software such as medical and CAD/CAM software.

It is also important to note that this document is not a replacement for the user interface guidelines and style guides that come with desktop environments. The purpose of this document is to complement such native documentation. So, wherever this document is silent the original guidelines apply.

### 1.3 Audience

This document is intended for the following an audience:

- Designers and developers of Persian graphical user interface applications
- Designers and developers of internationalized graphical user interface applications who intend to support Persian/Iran locale
